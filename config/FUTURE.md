In the future, if we were to add the ability to have reactions to messages, the following changes would be necessary:

User Interface: A user interface component to display reaction icons for each message.


Reaction Storage: A system to store and retrieve reactions associated with each message.


New Table: A reactions table would need to be created to store the relationship between messages, users, and their reactions.


If we were to add the ability to have threaded conversations, the following changes would be necessary:


User Interface: A mechanism to display and navigate threads, including replies nested under the original messages.


Thread Storage: A system to manage the relationship between parent and child messages.


Changes to Existing Table: The messages table would need to be updated to include a parent_id column.
